This program analyzes log files of an made up format:

[TIMESTAMP] [Version] [Severity] [ID #] <message>

There is a menu that allows users to query against the log file based on Date, Severity, ID, or a particular message string. If that sounds like a glorified grep to you, I don't disagree- it was for practice!
