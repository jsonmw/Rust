Failing to disconnect from collaborative computing devices (i.e. cameras) can result in subsequent compromises of organizational information. Providing easy methods to physically disconnect from such devices after a collaborative computing session helps to ensure that participants actually carry out the disconnect activity without having to go through complex and tedious procedures.

All domain accounts must be enabled for multifactor authentication with the exception of local emergency accounts. Multifactor authentication requires using two or more factors to achieve authentication. Factors include: 1) Something a user knows (e.g., password/PIN); 2) Something a user has (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); and 3) Something a user is (e.g., biometric). A privileged account is defined as an information system account with authorizations of a privileged user. Network access is defined as access to an information system by a user (or a process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a network (e.g., local area network, wide area network, or the Internet). Local access is defined as access to an organizational information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a direct connection without the use of a network.
